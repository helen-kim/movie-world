# Movie World | 67328 Mini Project

Created for a mini project to get accustomed to using jQuery and making API requests, we built a website called Movie World that provides the user with movie information using different API requests. We used the Movie Database API which provided detailed documentation for users to reference. 

The website is hosted using Now. For a live demo click here: https://ns-kqhqzwrqjf.now.sh/
